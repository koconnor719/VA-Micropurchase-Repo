Example of a Micro Purchase Statement of Work (SOW).
Micro-Consulting Work Statement – VA XXX XXX Application
Background [The background section provides context about the problem, the current response of the VA, and what the purpose of the solution would be]
In the private sector, the majority of large, consumer-facing organizations deliver XXXXXXXXXXXXX. As VA builds out its API ecosystem, it is exploring the possibility of creating a XXXXXX to allow Veterans, Servicemembers, caregivers, and dependents the ability to perform their most XXXXXXXXX.
VA currently has a XXXX, XXXX, that has a front end built in XXXX and a XXXX that connects to multiple backend VA systems and provides access to many of the services VA offers. The XXX and XXX are both open source and may be helpful for understanding what pieces of functionality exist today.
The Play [this section describes the goals of the solution, how certain problems with the solution itself may be addressed, how the private sector handles the problem]
Given XXXXX, which is already XXXX, and its associated XXXX as a starting point, what is the best way for VA to deliver the highest quality XXXXXXX, both quickly and in a way that can be maintained over time?
Some questions we are seeking answers to include: Should VA build XXX and XXX from scratch, and what would the pros and cons of that approach be? Should VA use primarily XXX XXX, and if so, which XXXXXXXX and why? Is there a hybrid framework or approach that VA should use, and if so which one and why? How could VA keep XXXXX and its website in sync as new features are added and content is changed over time?
What is the most common approach in the private sector when creating XXX XXX XXX that are based on an existing XXXXXX, and what does VA need to do to follow similar best practices? Where should VA start and what would be defined as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?
Deliverables [this section should explicitly describe the specific product or service, a roadmap for the deliverables]
•	Recommend an approach VA should take towards delivering XXXX, with the reasoning for why this approach is recommended and an explanation of what alternative approaches were considered and why they were not recommended.
•	Document which features of XXXXXX, if any, and what the specific benefits are of having those features be XXXX. This could include things like XXXXX or ability to XXXXXXXX as long as XXXX.
•	Create a roadmap for both an MVP XXXXXX as well as the next highest priority items after an MVP. What would need to be included in an MVP to have an acceptable product for VA to go to market with?
Deliverables shall be submitted to VA's GitHub Repo.
Time Box [This section describes the timeframe for the work]
VA anticipates a 2 week iteration to be sufficient. It is expected that there will be a kickoff meeting for the vendor to ask questions, then the vendor will present its research and draft deliverables at an intermediate point to incorporate user and Government feedback before submitting its final deliverables.
Vendors may propose alternate time frame for VA's consideration.
Disclaimer [this is necessary boilerplate language]
In order to avoid potential conflicts of interest, the Contractor will not be provided any non-public information to develop the deliverables. Additionally, all deliverables will be made publicly available in the VA GitHub repository.
In performance of this effort, the contractor shall not perform a function that requires access to a VA system or VA sensitive information (e.g., system administrator privileged access to a VA system, or contractor systems or processes that utilize VA sensitive information). Additionally, the contractor shall not connect one or more contractor-owned IT devices to a VA internal trusted network.
